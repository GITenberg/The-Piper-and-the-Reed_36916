<P CLASS="poem">
I am a reed&mdash;a little reed<BR>
Down by the river,<BR>
A whim of God whose moment's need<BR>
Was that the Giver<BR>
Might blow melodious and long<BR>
One cadence of eternal song.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Through me are blown<BR>
Wild whisperings of wind from hills<BR>
No sun hath known.<BR>
The splendour that Orion spills<BR>
On purple space;<BR>
The golden loom of Leo's mane;<BR>
The scintillance of Vega's face;<BR>
Dim unto dark:<BR>
And great Arcturus' far refrain<BR>
Fades to a silence that is pain,<BR>
When, like a lark,<BR>
Riseth melodious and strong<BR>
That cadence of eternal song.<BR>
God is the Piper&mdash;I, the reed<BR>
Down by the river for His need.<BR>
One note in those vast melodies<BR>
Waited on me,<BR>
Or else the choral companies<BR>
Went silently<BR>
Complaining to the muted stars:<BR>
"What lack we yet that Discord bars<BR>
That infinite Processional?"<BR>
Or else the seraphim would call:<BR>
"Minstrels, your dulcimers let fall<BR>
And break the silvern psalteries!"<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
A little reed&mdash;a little reed!<BR>
And yet were silence of that song,<BR>
Failed I the river's pebbled brim,<BR>
Nor trembled never unto him&mdash;<BR>
The Piper! passing where we throng<BR>
Vibrant and ready for His need.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
O Miracle!<BR>
He who in beauty goeth by<BR>
The marches of the meadowy sky,<BR>
A-piping on the many reeds<BR>
His canticle,<BR>
Paused in His playing;<BR>
For He found<BR>
An under-sound<BR>
Failed of the music that He made.<BR>
Wild winds went straying,<BR>
Like sheep lost on the daisied meads&mdash;<BR>
Scattered by Discord and afraid,<BR>
Lost from the fold<BR>
They knew of old.<BR>
My God had need<BR>
Of one more reed&mdash;<BR>
Had need of me<BR>
To make the perfect harmony.<BR>
I am that under-sound,<BR>
That needed note.<BR>
Eternally the Piper tried<BR>
Reed after reed until He found<BR>
Me growing by the river-side,<BR>
And laughing at the leaves that float<BR>
Forever down its burnished tide.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
How frail my body is&mdash;how frail<BR>
And common of its kind;<BR>
A reed among a field of reeds<BR>
A-tremble to the wind&mdash;<BR>
The wind that threshes like a flail<BR>
Until my body bleeds!<BR>
Yet through me such wild music blows<BR>
The Piper laughs among the stars.<BR>
Know you the Piper?  Little scars<BR>
Burn on His brow, each shoulder shows<BR>
Wounds of a knotted scourge that fell<BR>
To hurt Him from the hands of Hell!<BR>
Welcome, O Wind!<BR>
All hail, O Pain!<BR>
One little reed&mdash;one little reed,<BR>
To fill the Piper's far refrain,<BR>
Is broken till its body bleed;<BR>
Glad that the Minstrel Lord doth find<BR>
A tone of His eternal need.<BR>

  ALDEBARAN
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The minstrel tuned the triple strings&mdash;<BR>
His harp of many murmurings&mdash;<BR>
Then on a mighty chord began<BR>
A song of bright Aldebaran:<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P CLASS="t3">
I<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Aldebaran, Aldebaran,<BR>
One night I saw thee rise<BR>
Above the peaks of Ispahan,<BR>
Red on those purple skies.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Thou wast a royal ruby stone<BR>
Set in a diadem<BR>
Of some great god upon his throne,<BR>
Whose garment's ample hem<BR>
Was margined with the clustered spheres<BR>
Beyond a myriad of years.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Above thee soared the Pleiades,<BR>
Beneath, Auriga flared;<BR>
His vast melodic harmonies<BR>
Rigel with Algol shared:<BR>
Space trembled to the minstrelsy<BR>
Of Deneb and Alcyone.<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P CLASS="t3">
II<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Aldebaran, Aldebaran,<BR>
Betelguese sheathed his sword,<BR>
And in that cosmic cry began<BR>
The music of his word;<BR>
He spoke in syllables so strong,<BR>
Each sentence was an æon long:<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Thou art"&mdash;he thundered, "the first star<BR>
To lead earth out of mist,<BR>
When man looked up and felt afar<BR>
Urge of an ancient tryst<BR>
Made ere God lit the morning sun<BR>
To mark the length of day begun.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Thou threshold of the Zodiac;<BR>
Thou portal of the Rooms;<BR>
Thou first step of the starry Track:<BR>
Thou shuttle of the Looms<BR>
Where Fate weaves threads of purest gold<BR>
To fashion God's wide garment-fold&mdash;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Hail!"&mdash;and: "All hail!" from every sphere<BR>
That rolled across the void,<BR>
I heard, Aldebaran, with fear:<BR>
Each clustered asteroid<BR>
Flung back the tumult of that cry,<BR>
Like trumpet-voices through the sky.<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P CLASS="t3">
III<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then Vega rose and on her lyre<BR>
Played tremulous vast chords,<BR>
Singing the infinite desire<BR>
Of those celestial lords<BR>
Who shouted when earth's loom was laid,<BR>
And through the warp God's shuttle played;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
When through the loom of misted flame<BR>
The threads of God began<BR>
To weave a world; before there came<BR>
Adventuring of man<BR>
Upon the Path of life to find<BR>
Monitions of eternal Mind.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
She sang of forest and of fell,<BR>
Of mountain and of moor;<BR>
Caves and the caveman's battle-yell;<BR>
The song beside the door<BR>
Where women ground the meal and sung<BR>
Rhymes in their rude primeval tongue.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I saw the mammoth and the bear,<BR>
Like moving mountains, run<BR>
In terror from the flint-head spear,<BR>
Proving that man had won<BR>
Lordship of earth; and I made prayer,<BR>
Aldebaran, before thee there!<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P CLASS="t3">
IV<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Arcturus lifted high his horn<BR>
And blew a mighty blast.<BR>
The curtain of the night was torn<BR>
To show the protoplast<BR>
Transfigured on the finer face<BR>
Of that far prehistoric race&mdash;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
We, clumsy, call Lemurian!<BR>
A city lifted high<BR>
Its towered domes of daring man<BR>
Beneath a tropic sky,<BR>
With gates of gold that gleamed and shone<BR>
Brighter than portaled Babylon.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Men were as gods upon the earth,<BR>
The women were most fair;<BR>
Music was speech; a holy birth<BR>
Of art was cradled there&mdash;<BR>
For dreams took shape in pure jacinth,<BR>
Seraphic brows upon the plinth.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Reed instruments for dance and song;<BR>
Brave horns beneath the blue;<BR>
The sistrum and the thunder-gong;<BR>
The pipe and tabour, too;<BR>
And all the craft of minstrelsy:<BR>
Harp, sackbut, cymbal, psaltery,<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Were fashioned.  Then was genius stirred<BR>
To pre-Homeric lines,<BR>
And drama grew.  On earth was heard<BR>
Praise of the fruitful vines,<BR>
Oil of the olive, barley-gold,<BR>
Leaping of lambs within the fold.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Told was the story of the stars,<BR>
And thine, Aldebaran,<BR>
When Jupiter was not, nor Mars;<BR>
When every shepherd-clan<BR>
Pointed and named the olden spheres<BR>
While Rome was in the womb of years.<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P CLASS="t3">

</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Altair in Aquila stood forth<BR>
With flaming evil brow,<BR>
Looked from his tower to the north<BR>
And made an awful vow:<BR>
"I will destroy yon golden gates&mdash;<BR>
Hither to me, O shrouded Fates!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Hither to me and hide the sun,<BR>
Darken the noisy noon,<BR>
Snuff out the planets one by one,<BR>
Unleash the hot simoon;<BR>
Destroy the race Lemurian!"<BR>
And they obeyed, Aldebaran.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Thunder!<BR>
A woman by the well<BR>
Looked up wide-eyed and fell;<BR>
A shepherd leading forth his sheep,<BR>
Gasped, clutched his throat and found eternal sleep;<BR>
Ceased in the temple, horn and holy drum,<BR>
And all the vested choristers were dumb!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Rain as of fire!<BR>
The shivering of earth;<BR>
Dead is the baby at its birth&mdash;<BR>
With horror in her great dark eyes,<BR>
The new-made mother lifeless lies;<BR>
Two lovers in the spell of their first kiss<BR>
And whispered word, the dark abyss<BR>
Engulfs forever!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Night!  Endless night!<BR>
There are no towers, temples, domes&mdash;<BR>
No palaces, no pillared homes;<BR>
And all that stately company<BR>
Are buried in a boiling sea!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Alas, for these, Aldebaran!<BR>
And woe to Altair and his hate!<BR>
Gone is the race Lemurian;<BR>
I weep, O Star, to sing their fate!<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P CLASS="t3">
VI<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And for a while the court was still,<BR>
Tense, waiting on the harpist's will,<BR>
From lord and lady to the King.<BR>
One spoke: "It was an evil thing!"<BR>
One: "Hush!  He is about to sing."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The jester shook his golden bells,<BR>
And laughed: "A pretty tale he tells<BR>
Of Altair and Aldebaran;<BR>
Faith!  Never since court-fools began<BR>
Was heard the like.&mdash;Lemurian!"<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
A bishop raised his mitred head:<BR>
"It was the Flood, I think"&mdash;he said.<BR>
"Aye, even so"&mdash;replied a priest:<BR>
"Was not that city in the east?<BR>
Altair?&mdash;Apocalyptic Beast!"<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then spake the King upon his throne:<BR>
"Never such harping have I known;<BR>
It is a right majestic tale&mdash;<BR>
How poetry and song prevail<BR>
On sword and shield and burnished mail!"<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Again the minstrel tuned the strings&mdash;<BR>
His harp of many murmurings&mdash;<BR>
Again on softer chord began<BR>
The song of bright Aldebaran:<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P CLASS="t3">
VII<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Aldebaran, Aldebaran,<BR>
Last night I saw thee glow<BR>
In Taurus&mdash;open like a fan&mdash;<BR>
Above a world of snow.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The joyous bells were ringing wide<BR>
Their plangent silver chime,<BR>
Proclaiming: "It is Christmastide!<BR>
Now is the time, the time,<BR>
The Holy Babe was brought to birth,<BR>
And Lord Messias came to earth!"<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Wast thou not then that eastern Star<BR>
The Magi did behold,<BR>
Who journeyed from a city far<BR>
To offer gifts of gold&mdash;<BR>
The Star of Jesu, leading them<BR>
To little white-walled Bethlehem?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Aldebaran, Aldebaran,<BR>
Across the crystal sky<BR>
A shout of angel-song began:<BR>
"Glory to God on High,<BR>
On earth be peace!  Now is the morn<BR>
In which Emmanuel is born!"<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
They sang the end of every woe,<BR>
The tale of every tear.<BR>
I saw a host of singers go<BR>
Bravely against the fear<BR>
That held men in the thongs of Fate<BR>
Through æons of the hell of Hate.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Before thy lance Altair went down,<BR>
Lemuria arose<BR>
Restored to temple, palace, crown,<BR>
With gates that never close;<BR>
And all her shining company<BR>
Renewed their art and minstrelsy.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The babe was in his mother's arms,<BR>
His face was like the Christ;<BR>
And that lost lover knew the charms<BR>
Of her who kept the tryst;<BR>
The woman filled her water jar,<BR>
The shepherd led his sheep afar.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And then I knew, Aldebaran,<BR>
Lemuria is one<BR>
With all the domes of daring man<BR>
That glitter to the sun;<BR>
That age by age one broad highway<BR>
Leads up the host to fuller day.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
There shall no lost tall towers be,<BR>
No idle aim of art;<BR>
No useless joy of minstrelsy,<BR>
No ever-empty heart;<BR>
No utter silencing of song,<BR>
No comrade absent from the throng.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Through pain and trial of the tears,<BR>
Lead up the host, O Star!<BR>
Lead up, lead up, until the years<BR>
Have glorified the scar<BR>
That burns upon the brow of man,<BR>
Aldebaran, Aldebaran!<BR>

Come dear Comrade, let us sing&mdash;<BR>
Not to any tightened string<BR>

Anthems of the common day.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
How many Christs have we two crucified;<BR>
How many prophets have we sawn asunder;<BR>
What wild woe have we wrought: how deep, how wide<BR>
The wrong committed!  In the sky God's thunder<BR>
Threatens, His lightning cleaves the clouds apart<BR>
To show an awful Face&mdash;<BR>
The Judge is in His place<BR>
Of Judgment!  Oh, the love<BR>
That we have lost!  Above,<BR>
Beneath and all around us sounds the cry<BR>
Of Rachel weeping over little hands<BR>
And little feet!  Her babes are dead!  You, I,<BR>
Alone are guilty; for while error stands<BR>
Must all the starry Christs be crucified!<BR>

Nay, do not hang your head:<BR>
Though Christs be crucified,<BR>

Its mother-bosom broad<BR>
With vision and with dream&mdash;<BR>
Are you, Comrade and I!<BR>
Yea, all its ancient shores<BR>
That river runneth by<BR>
Have we touched.  Where it pours<BR>
Past leagues of desert-sand,<BR>
Jungles and miry places,<BR>
Palms of an unknown land,<BR>
Ferns and their fronded faces;<BR>
Have we gone forth from God!<BR>

And crocodiles are torpid in the sun;<BR>
Where snarling tigers sprawl,<BR>

To the river where the little shells are strawed;<BR>
Where chattering monkeys leap,<BR>
And the flamingo struts among the reeds;<BR>
Where parrots pause and peep,<BR>
And all day long the greedy ibis feeds:<BR>
We went flowing, flowing,<BR>

From the impulse of the mighty love of God!<BR>

Lift up your head, O my Brother, my friend!<BR>

Dreamt in the depths of an infinite peace<BR>
Ere the first star of the morning arose<BR>
Over the earth!  Since that river's release<BR>
From the pure spring, how it flows!  How it flows,<BR>
Bears on its bosom the sorrows of man,<BR>
Sin and the wreckage of faith and of truth,<BR>
Lust and hot murder, the primitive ban:<BR>
"Eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth"!<BR>

Did you, dearest, understand<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Lift your head and meet my gaze.<BR>
Do you not recall<BR>
Somewhere in a golden haze,<BR>
Vistaed vast, a hall<BR>
Paved with diamond and domed<BR>
Blue above a fount that foamed<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
With the water from the well<BR>
Guarded, so they say,<BR>
By the angel Israfel?<BR>
Water of eternal bliss<BR>
Sprinkled on the lips that kiss!<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
There we lived before the suns<BR>
Led the planets up;<BR>
There we pledged the winged Ones<BR>
In a crystal cup,<BR>
Ere we left that pillared home<BR>
Through the field of Time to roam.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Why," you ask me, dearest, "why<BR>
Did we leave that place&mdash;<BR>

What if love must lose to gain,<BR>
Find eternal peace in pain?<BR>

"But I want the Ever-Now!"<BR>
Dear, do you not know<BR>
They who drive the patient plough<BR>

"Let the scattered fragments be<BR>

Thus, my Maid of long ago,<BR>
Here within the field<BR>

In the room that day we met,<BR>

AFTER THE FEAST<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
I have drunk deeply of the cup,<BR>
Fared well and fed;<BR>
The guests with whom I sat to sup,<BR>
Are gone to bed:<BR>
A broken harp lies on the floor,<BR>
Its tangled strings will sound no more&mdash;<BR>
The wine-stained linen I deplore.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Here is a little trampled rose,<BR>
A violet;<BR>
Here is a hyacinth, and those<BR>
Are mignonette:<BR>
They looked so proudly from their place,<BR>
First at the feast&mdash;with tears I trace<BR>
Now but a vestige of that grace.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Upon the table is a crown&mdash;<BR>
Where is the King?<BR>
The little leaves that tremble down,<BR>
Cover a ring;<BR>
A vase of crystal shattered lies<BR>
Against a goblet, where the wise<BR>
Talked through the laughter.  How time flies!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
It is not very long ago,<BR>
Here in the hall,<BR>
When to the tapers' tangled glow<BR>
The rise and fall<BR>
Of voices over nuts and wine<BR>
Murmured like wind through leaf and vine;<BR>
And there was joy of me and mine.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I snuff the tapers one by one.<BR>
The darkness falls.<BR>
Alas, for feasting and for fun!<BR>
My madrigals<BR>
Are ended.  I will not again<BR>
Sing.  Sound of wind and weeping rain<BR>
Is now the interlude of pain!<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Yet it was good to know the feast,<BR>
To be a guest;<BR>
Though at the table I was least<BR>
Among the best.<BR>
Blindly I grope unto the door,<BR>
Gather a flower from the floor&mdash;<BR>
I will come back here never more!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
What!  Never more go gladly back?<BR>
Ah, foolish me!<BR>
When down the winding starry track<BR>
The company,<BR>
With laughter their lord following,<BR>
Shall yet return to greet the King<BR>
Who claims the crown and wears the ring!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And though I have put out each light,<BR>
Gathered one flower,<BR>
Bravely I fare forth into night&mdash;<BR>
What is an hour,<BR>
A day, a year, if, after all<BR>
The silence, those dear comrades call,<BR>
And there is harping in the hall?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I wait the summons; gladly go<BR>
Against the rain;<BR>
They will be seated row on row<BR>
Here once again:<BR>
And in that brave, loved company<BR>
What song and laughter there will be,<BR>
When I resume my minstrelsy!<BR>

Beyond the lure of any mart.<BR>

This starry way?<BR>

Wide-open wings,<BR>

With pomp of place and rank and pride.<BR>

If on your path there be a cross,<BR>
A wayside cross,<BR>
With nails and sponge and spear,<BR>
A gambling Guard who turn to toss<BR>
Dice for the robe you wear;<BR>
Avoid not that appointed place,<BR>
Though thorns with crimson stain your face!<BR>

But if you take this road, my friend,<BR>
My wistful friend,<BR>
Your world will wake to song,<BR>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
